# Random Quote Machine

This is a page that displays random quotes from the [Forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/).

I'm not sure about the rate limit on this. The API appears to be free and open (no API key required),
but the documentation is very limited.

The ability for the user to tweet a quote will also be added.

Built with HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, and good old JS.

**NOTE:** compiling the SCSS files requires Sass. From the `css` directory, run:

 `sass --update style.scss:style.css`.
